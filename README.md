## Sorting of Todo Items:

- Completed Todos: Sorted in ascending order by ID.
- Incomplete Todos: Positioned at the top and sorted in descending order by ID

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. npm install express ws
2. npm add react-dom
3. Client: npm start / Server: to start the server from the server.js file -> Open a terminal and run node server.js 

## Debugging
- The issue with the onCompleteAll PUT request returning a 400 Bad Request error was due to sending data:-1. This data was not valid, so I modified the request to use an empty body.
- Additionally, since updating all todos can be done successfully with a POST request, I changed the implementation to use a POST request instead.
- Empty inputs are now treated as 'No title'.
